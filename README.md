# AS-Tetris
A Open Source Tetris Game which can be modified for custom game modes and custom Tetris pieces!

From this project I learnt how to use the Pygame library to develop my own modules such as buttons, menus, text and how to display graphics on to the screen.

I also:
- Learned how to only import libraries required in my project to reduce the amount of unused code.
- Learned how to format and export and import data to help retain my local leaderboard system.
- Developed further understanding around classes and objects.
- How to avoid circular imports while modularising my code.

> This was a fun and enjoyable project as I learnt a lot, but there are still improvements such as shrinking function sizes to improve readability.
